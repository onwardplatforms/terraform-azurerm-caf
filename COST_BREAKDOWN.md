## üí∞ Cost Optimization Strategies

### 1. Reserved Instances & Savings Plans
```yaml
Savings Potential:
  1-year Reserved: 20-40% savings
  3-year Reserved: 40-60% savings
  Spot VMs: Up to 90% savings

Best for:
  ‚úÖ Predictable workloads
  ‚úÖ Long-term projects (1+ years)
  ‚úÖ Production environments
  ‚ùå Development/testing (use auto-shutdown instead)
```

### 2. Auto-Scaling & Scheduling
```yaml
Strategies:
  - VM auto-shutdown: 50-70% savings for dev/test
  - AKS node autoscaling: 20-40% savings
  - App Service auto-scale: 15-30% savings
  - Function Apps consumption: Pay only for execution

Implementation:
  - Scale down after business hours
  - Weekend shutdowns for non-prod
  - Seasonal scaling adjustments
```

### 3. Storage Optimization
```yaml
Lifecycle Policies:
  Hot ‚Üí Cool (30 days): 46% storage savings
  Cool ‚Üí Archive (90 days): 90% storage savings

Techniques:
  - Blob lifecycle management
  - Unused disk deletion
  - Compress data before storage
  - Use appropriate redundancy level
```

### 4. Right-Sizing Resources
```yaml
Common Over-Provisioning:
  VM CPUs: Often 2-4x oversized
  Database DTUs: 30-50% overprovisioned
  App Service Plans: Wrong tier selection

Monitoring Tools:
  - Azure Advisor recommendations
  - Azure Cost Management
  - Third-party cost optimization tools
```

### 5. Network Cost Optimization
```yaml
Data Transfer Costs:
  Inbound: Usually FREE
  Outbound: $0.087+ per GB

Optimization:
  - Use CDN for global content
  - Optimize data transfer patterns
  - Leverage Azure regions strategically
  - Use ExpressRoute for high-volume transfers
```
